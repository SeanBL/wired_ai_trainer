Apply pressure and rinse the wound with clean water to remove all dirt. Before drying and covering with a bandage, apply antibiotic cream or ointment. Watch the puncture for signs of infection, such as spreading redness, pain, swelling, or fever."

    "text": "Avulsions are severe injuries that can cause uncontrolled, life-threatening bleeding. This type of injury typically occurs when skin or a body part is partially or completely torn away. These injuries often result from serious trauma, such as car or motorcycle accidents, explosions, or gunshots. In avulsions, bleeding will occur instantly and extensively, so an ambulance and emergency attention is immediately needed. For some avulsions, you may need to apply a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. If a body part is severed, it should be brought to the hospital for possible reattachment. Wrap the body part in a clean cloth and pack it in ice, if possible."
