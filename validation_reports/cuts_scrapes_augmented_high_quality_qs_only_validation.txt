  #3 (Sim: 0.505)
  Q: What symptoms indicate a cut or scrape is minor?
  A: A minor cut should stop bleeding quickly on its own. The body‚Äôs response is to clot the wound, and a small cut should stop bleeding quickly. Mild cuts should "ooze," meaning bleed slowly, because bleeding should affect only the top layers of the skin and should not be gushing or have a pulsating flow, which requires an immediate call for an ambulance or emergency care.
